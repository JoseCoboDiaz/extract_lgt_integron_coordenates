# extract_lgt_integron_coordenates
A ruby script to extract lateral gene transfer events (LGT) position and integron position from output files generated by waafle (https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/waafle) and Integron_Finder (https://github.com/gem-pasteur/Integron_Finder).

It is important that you also need R software installed, because a R-script will be used to transpose the data matrix.

To run this scripts:

<i>ruby extract_lgt_position.rb waafle.txt<i>

<i>ruby extract_integron_position.rb contigs.integrons<i>

where waafle.txt and contigs.integrons are output files from waafle and Integron_Finder pipelines.

It will generate the following files:
- lgt_positions.txt: coordenates of all LGT detected by waafle 
- integrasa_position.txt: coordenates of all the integrasas detected by Integron_Finder
- protintegron_position.txt: coordenates of all coding regions detected by Integron_Finder
